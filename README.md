# BDL-DEV-API
A OSS repo for contributions to the Bad Date List project

Totally insufficient instructions: Fork and clone this repo, `npm i` to install dependencies, `npm run start` to run api server. Server must be running to see functionality when working on the BDL-DEV-CLIENT client side server. 

More details coming soon...
